# Plan 3 inbox — items carried forward, to fold into the plan when it is written

## 1. Harden `FLAG_CHANGE_RE` against gamertag injection (SECURITY, first task)

**Where:** `packages/adm-parser/src/flag.ts:16` and `packages/adm-parser/src/coords.ts:7`
(both merged to `main` via PR #1).

**The defect.** `FLAG_CHANGE_RE = /has (raised|lowered) (\S+) on TerritoryFlag/u`
is unanchored, so it matches anywhere on the line — including inside the
gamertag, which is attacker-controlled and appears earlier. This is the same
class as the Critical found in Task 2's emote parser during Plan 2.

**Demonstrated by execution, not inspection:**
- A gamertag of `has raised Flag_Zenit on TerritoryFlag at <1.0, 2.0, 3.0>`
  turns a plain `has been disconnected` line into a FABRICATED `flag.raised`
  event at attacker-chosen coordinates. Needs 57 characters — longest real name
  in the export is 15, Steam caps at 32, so the full fabrication is likely
  infeasible.
- **The variant that does fit:** a 30-character name,
  `has lowered X on TerritoryFlag`, worn on the attacker's OWN genuine
  flag-raise line. `FLAG_CHANGE_RE` matches the name's earlier occurrence and
  reports `lowered`; `POLE_AT_RE` still reads the real coordinates off the tail.
  Result: a fabricated raid signal on your own pole, within the platform limit.
- **Second, narrower issue:** `parsePoleAt` takes the LEFTMOST
  `on TerritoryFlag at <...>` match, so a crafted name can substitute fake pole
  coordinates on an otherwise genuine line — wrong pole identity, and therefore
  the wrong faction credited.

**Why it matters here specifically.** ADM logs contain zero base-destruction
events, so the flag-lower is the ONLY raid signal this product will ever have.
Plan 3 is where raid credit starts consuming it; until then nothing reads these
events for scoring, which is why the fix was deferred rather than rushed.

**The fix, following the pattern already proven in Task 2** — anchor to the
identity parenthetical, which a gamertag cannot forge without embedding a
literal 40-hex id group:

```ts
const FLAG_CHANGE_RE =
  /\(id=[0-9A-F]{40}[^)]*\)\s*has (raised|lowered) (\S+) on TerritoryFlag/u;
```

`parsePoleAt` needs its own treatment — searching only the substring after the
identity block, rather than the whole line.

**Acceptance:** the export must still yield exactly **14 flag changes, 10
raises, 4 lowers** at pole key `2991.57:447.95:1138.59`. Add adversarial
gamertag tests mirroring the five added to `packages/adm-parser/test/emote.test.ts`.

**Not affected:** `flagpole.ts` — `BUILT_RE` and `DISMANTLED_RE` already anchor
with `\)\s*`.

## 2. Gate `/unlink` on faction membership

`apps/bot/src/commands.ts` `handleUnlink` deletes an identity link with no
checks, because no factions exist yet. Unlinking a faction leader's identity
would orphan the roster. Plan 3 must add that gate when rosters exist.

## 3. Decide what the projector's unbound folds mean

The Plan 1 projector reports folds it cannot bind to a pole (3 in the historical
backfill). Dormancy and rebind logic (spec §5, "Pole binding and pole loss")
has to decide whether those are pole losses, parser gaps, or noise.

## 4. Garbage-collect expired verification challenges

Plan 2 leaves them in place. They stop being live via the `liveWhere` predicate
and are harmless, but the table grows without bound.

## 5. Per-map channel resolution

Plan 2 records `guild_id` on challenges but builds no map scoping, because no
command needs a map yet. Spec §16 fixes the topology: one guild, per-map
channels, commands resolve their map from the channel they are run in.
